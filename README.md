# Hi there, I'm Michelle Tilley (BinaryMuse) 👋

I'm a passionate software developer focused on building developer tools that enhance productivity and improve the command-line experience. I believe in creating elegant solutions that make developers' lives easier through well-crafted, open-source software.

I also do independent AI research, with a focus on computational functionalism and what it means to "think."

## 💼 Experience

### Atuin
I'm currently working as a Founding Engineer at [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh), building tools that transform how developers interact with their shell history and workflows.
